Setup
• Locations:
– The test takes place both inside and outside the Arena.
– The robot starts at a predefined location in the living room.
• People: The operator is standing in front of the robot and is pointing at the bag to be
carried outside.
• Objects: At least two bags are placed near the operator (within a 2m distance and visible
to the robot).
Procedure
1. Picking up the bag: The robot picks up the bag pointed at by the operator.
2. Following the operator: The robot should inform the operator when it is ready to follow
them. The operator walks naturally towards the car; after reaching the car, the operator
takes the bag back and thanks the robot.
3. Obstacles: The robot will face 4 obstacles along its way (in arbitrary order): (a) a small
object on the ground, (b) a hard-to-see object, (c) a crowd of people obstructing the path
outside, and (d) a small area blocked using retractable barriers.
4. Optional goals:
4.1. Re-entering the arena: The robot returns to the arena, going back in through the
entrance.
4.2. Following the queue: After the robot has reached the car, a few of the people that
formed the crowd obstructing the robot return to the arena in a queue. The robot
can decide to join the queue on its way back to the arena, in a manner that appears
natural to the people in the queue.
