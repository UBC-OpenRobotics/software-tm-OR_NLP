Setup
• Locations:
– Start location: Before the test, the robot waits outside the Arena and navigates to
the testing area when the door is open.
– Test location: The testing area has a cabinet and a table nearby.
• People:
– No people are involved in the test, unless the robot requires human assistance.
• Furniture:
– Table: The table has 5–10 objects placed on it and the robot can choose which ones
to grasp and in what order. On small tables, objects will be added as the robot frees
up space.
– Cabinet: The cabinet contains objects arranged in groups — either by category or
likeliness — on different shelves.
– Cabinet door: The cabinet door is open by default, but the team leader can request
the door to be closed and score additional points for opening it. If the robot fails to
open the door, it must clearly state this and request the referee to open it.
• Objects:
– Table objects: The object on the table are arranged arbitrarily.
– Cabinet objects: Some of the objects are placed behind the cabinet door and cannot
be accessed unless the door is open.
Procedure
1. Table location: At least two hours before the test, the referees announce the table and
cabinet that will be used in the test, as well as a rough location of the table.
informs the referees:
• whether the cabinet door should be closed
• whether a heavy and/or a tiny object should be used in the test
3. Test start: The robot moves to the testing area when the arena door is open.
4. Storing groceries: After identifying the table (and optionally opening the cabinet door),
the robot moves the objects from the table to the cabinet.
