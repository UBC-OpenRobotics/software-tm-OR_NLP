Setup
• Locations:
– Start location: Before the test, the robot waits outside the Arena and navigates to
the kitchen when the door is open.
– Test location: The test itself takes place in the kitchen.
• People:
– No people are involved in the test unless the robot requires human assistance.
• Furniture:
– Table: The robot serves breakfast on the table which is announced beforehand.
– Chairs: Chairs may be placed around the table and won’t be removed.
– Doors: The robot does not need to open any doors to find the breakfast items.
• Objects:
– All objects used in the test are in their predefined locations when the test starts.
Procedure
1. Table selection: At least two hours before the test, the referees announce the surface
that will be used as a table.
2. Test start: The robot moves to the kitchen when the arena door is open.
3. Serving breakfast: To serve breakfast, the robot has to place breakfast items on a table
(bowl, spoon, cereal box, and milk carton).
4. Pouring cereal: After placing the breakfast items on the table, the robot should pour
cereal into the bowl.
5. Optional goals:
• Pouring milk: After pouring cereal, the robot pours milk into the bowl in order to
fully prepare the breakfast.
• Placing the spoon next to the bowl: In principle, the spoon can be placed
anywhere on the table, but placing it next to the bowl is desired so that it is easily
reachable by a person.
