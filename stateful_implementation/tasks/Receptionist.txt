Setup
• Location:
– The test takes place in the living room.
– The robot starts inside the Arena at a predefined location near the entrance door.
– Entrance: The entrance door is open by default. The team leader can request to
close the door to score additional points by opening it for the guests.
• People:
– Host: The host’s name and favorite drink will be announced before the test. The
host is already sitting in the living room.
– Guests: Both guests have a name and favorite drink. An arriving guest will either
step in front of the robot or ring the bell if the door is closed. Guests have to be guided
to the living room to be introduced. Each of the guest will arrive separately. The
sound of the bell will be provided to teams during setup period before competition.
Procedure
• Introductions: When introducing guests, the robot must clearly identify the person
being introduced and state their name and favorite drink. Introducing two people means
to introduce them to each other.
• Seating People: The robot must point at a place or location where the guest can sit.
• Switching Places: Guests may switch places after they were seated.
• Describing the First Guest: Naming at least 4 characteristics of the first guest, i.e.,
color of clothes, color of hair, gender, and age, earns bonus points.
• Looking at person/direction of navigation: During verbal interactions and descrip-
tions of people, robot looks at the conversational partner. Robot can point at the person
being introduce/described or alternate gaze between two people. During navigation robot
looks in the direction where it is going. Persistently gazing towards unrelated person or
incorrect direction while moving during the task deducts points.
