I will give you a set of instructions that a robot must follow. 
You must generate a finite state machine in JSON format that has these fields in each state: name, description, functions, next_states, instructions. 
Name and description describe the state. 
The instructions must be highly detailed for each state, and explain in thorough detail what needs to be accomplished. 
Describe how the functions should be used and what the robot must accomplish in each state in order to progress to the next. 
The functions are available to the robot to use in that state. 
The robot should only have access to relevant functions. 
Next_states are any states that can be transitioned to from the current state after calling a function available in that state. 
Since the robot will execute a series of instructions, make sure that if it needs to collect information about the environment, it can transition to the same state (ie if it needs to process camera information, then one of the transitions should be the same state). 
Please only return a JSON string.
